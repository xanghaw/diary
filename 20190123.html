        My location in the office is fantastic.<br>
        Last year I was able to pick the first number from the lot and choose this seat without any interference.<br>
        Most values of this seat is no one can't steal a glance my monitors.<br>
        It means I can do whatever I want without any borther.<br><br>
        Finally It remains only two days left what I can sit this posotion.<br>
        The new seat is not bad also.<br>
        Compare with this seat the new seat is more open to others and less solitary.<br>
        Maybe It would be impossible, read a book or do internet shopping at working hours but I think It's enough last one year.<br>
        Let's step into 2019 year. Lego!<br>
