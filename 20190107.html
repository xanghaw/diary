        This week I have 2 appointments.<br>
        first is this Thursday with 'JoongYeon' and friends.<br>
        second is 'Chul-In' and friends.<br>
        In this two groups are same in some way.<br>
        The diffence is 'JoongYeon' group is more past members.<br>
        with them I got a lot of happy memories. at that time I worked really hard and improved my skills very much I imagined. also that time was very tough. that time when I was in the middle of that time I didn't know I got a very high technologies. I wished every day escape form that category jobs.<br>
        But now I can see that time at third-party point of views and realize that made me stronger and hader. without that time I will not being my position now.<br>
        So I appreciate myself and my co-workers had stand that time <br>
