        I leaned How to make replay on Website<br>
        How cool it is!<br>
        After learn JavaScript I expect to make more cool my web diary.<br>

        In other matters, In My company web site One issue made me being unpleasant.<br>
        The issue is support fund about a kindergaten.<br>
        My company has already support funds to parents who has childs 200000 won per month.<br>
        Today someone bring up a problem that the support funds sum is to little in these days so insist that should be increased.<br>
        I think It is totally bullshuit.<br>
        they already receive enough salary to support their child at a kindergaten.<br>
        I think It is unfair someone doesn't have child or being single.<br>
        Many peoples(amount 95%) thought I was wrong and they said I'm totally misunderstand what the welfare means.<br>
        But I think they just want to get more money in any way   <br>
