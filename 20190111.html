        Only few years ago we worked in same office but now more than half members moved to other departs and work new field includ me.<br><br>

        few hours ago I received message which is my university friends father death today<br>
        I know he haven't attend our meetings a few years.<br>
        I guess he sent a hard time during that.<br>
        he's fathers funeral parlor is too far form my place. I don't attend.<br>
        Many other friends are heading there now. I just sent condolence money.<br>
