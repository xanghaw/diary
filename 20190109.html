        I leaned How to make replay on Website<br>
        How cool it is!<br>
        After lean JavaScript I expect to make more cool my web diary.<br><br>
        In other metters, In My compay web site One issue makes me being unpleasant.<br>
        The issue is support fund about a kindergaten.<br>
        My copany has already support funds to parents who has childs 200000 won per month.<br>
        Today somebody issued support funds sum is to little in these days and want to increase.<br>
        I think It is totally bullshuit.<br>
        they already receive enough salary to support their child at a kindergaten.<br>
        I think It make unfare someone who doesn't have child or singles.<br>
        Many peoples(amount 95%) thought I was wrong and I can't understand what the welfare.<br>
        But I think they just want to get more money in any account.<br>
